# ProgrammingTest
This is a repository is for a programming test. 
On the first objective, the method was first converting each string to binary, and then evaluate each 2 bits of binary to DNA nucleotide.
The second objective, I just used the encoded DNA, and replaced it with it's complement.
So G -> C
   C -> G
   T -> A
   A -> U
   
And for the fourth objective, I matched the example DNA strand, with it's complement match.
A -> T
T -> A
G -> C
C -> G
And then do the reverse of objective one. Decode each DNA nucleotide into 2 bit binary, combine them into string. And then evalutate
the binary while in string form.
